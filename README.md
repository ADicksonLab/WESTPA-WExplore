# WESTPA-WExplore Plugin
A plugin to run the [WExplore](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp411479c) algorithm in the [WESTPA](http://chong.chem.pitt.edu/WESTPA) toolkit.

# Installation
First, assuming 'conda' is in your path, run create_conda_environment.sh
Then, init.sh

We're assuming that you're using a version of GROMACS which uses 'gmx'.  And also, that it's in your path.

If that's not the case, modify env.sh such that it's true.
